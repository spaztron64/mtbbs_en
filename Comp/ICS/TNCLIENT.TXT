TNCLIENT is a very basic telnet program with ANSI terminal emulation.
It is based on various components:
TWsocket:   Low level TCP/IP socket encapsulation
TTnCnx:	    TCP/IP telnet protocol
TEmulVT:    ANSI terminal emulation
TTnEmultVT: TEmulVT and TTnCnx together
TWait:      Component to wait for event

There are 3 directories: a main directory with the project source 
files and two directories with the components: one for 
Delphi 1 (VC) and one for Delphi 2 and 3 (VC32). All the source code
is fully compatible with all Delphi versions. Hence the component source
is duplicated in VC and VC32 subdirectories just for your facility.
There is only on source file special for Delphi 1: this is WINSOCK.PAS.
This file must NOT be used with Delphi 2 or Delphi 3 as there is such a
file accompagning the Borland products. So for Delphi 2 and 3: use the
Borland WINSOCK.PAS file; for Delphi 1 use the provided WINSOCK.PAS file.

Use the PKUNZIP -d option to unzip the archive or you will mess 
up all files !

Once it is unzipped, you must install all components 
in Delphi component palette as you do with any other VCL. Then 
you can rebuild the application using the project file TnClient.dpr.
