This is a very very basic server showing how to use the TWSocket 
object to build custom internet or intranet applications.

There are 3 directories: a main directory with the project source 
files and two directories with the TWSocket VCL: one for 
Delphi 1 (VC) and one for Delphi 2 (VC32). Use the PKUNZIP -d option
to unzip the archive or you will mess up all files !

Once it is unzipped, you must install WSocket and Wait components 
in Delphi compomnent palette as you do with any other VCL. Then 
you can rebuild all the files.

If you like my code, let me know. I'll keep you informed for 
future updates.
