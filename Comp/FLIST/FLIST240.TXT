© Amedeo Lanza di Casalanza <amldc@tin.it>

description:

 TFileList is a TCustomListView descendant wich encapsulates some system 
functions to behave somehow like an Explorer's file window. It can  show file 
informations ignored by Explorer's window.

Files in the original release:
FileList.pas	Delphi units containing TFileList class source
FileList.dcr	Resource file with TFileList bitmap
FileList.rtf	Docs in RTF format
FListxxx.txt	Readme file
FListxxx.inf	inf file for upload to DSP
MaskSearch.pas	Utility unit from the MstGrep.zip archive (by Marcus
		Stephany). This is included since i modified it, please check
		on DSP for original release of MstGrep.

Usage

 Just drop a TFileList on a form, add a DirList (or better a DirTree by 
Markus Stephany) and a line of code to update the FileList's Directory 
property upon changing of DirList's Directory. Also you may wanto to add 
a FilterComboBox (or/and a PathComboBox by Angus Johnson) and again 
write a line of code to update the TFileList's Mask upon changing of 
FilterComboBox's one.

 You may customize columns' captions and width using the  SectColCaption 
and SetColWidth public procedures.

 You can then add file masks using the AddMask procedure. Be warned that 
TFileList defaults to '*.*', so you have to set Mask to an empty string 
before adding masks.
