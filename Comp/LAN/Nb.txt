------------------

Nb.pas is a Netbios unit that allows you to make
Netbios calls according to IBM's netbios 3.0 specs.

It is equivalent to the Delphi 3.0x Nb30.pas unit, except that it
also compiles for 16 bit Delphi 1, and 32-bit Delphi 2 and 3.

The sample project shows you how to get the MAC address of a network
interface using Netbios calls. It should work on any networked PC running
a Microsoft Windows network, regardless of the protocol used (Netbios
running over TCP/IP, Netbeui or IPX).

If you need this stuff, then you should know what I am talking about anyway.

-------------------

"kanca" <kanca@ibm.net> discovered that the 32-bit version
did not work on Windows NT 4.

I now changed the 32-bit code so that it :

	- enumerates all adapters in the system
	- gets the corresponding MAC address
	- works on Windows NT 4.0
